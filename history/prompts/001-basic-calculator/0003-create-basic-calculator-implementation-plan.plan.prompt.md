All aspects of the plan are covered. You can now proceed to defining tasks.
Suggested next command: `/sp.tasks`
```

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The implementation plan for the basic calculator has been successfully created.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run as part of this step.
- 📁 Files: Created `/home/ayan/kamran/calc/specs/001-basic-calculator/plan.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The next step is to define tasks using `/sp.tasks`.
- 🧠 Reflection: The plan was created based on the specification and user input, covering technical context, project structure, and constitution checks.
